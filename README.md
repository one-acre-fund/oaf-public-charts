## How to contribute

This repository has the following CI workflows:

* Every PR will lint and test all updated charts using [chart-testing](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing)
  * __Note__: this will fail if any chart is updated without bumping its version - so that published versions remain immutable
* Every merge to `main` branch will publish all updated charts using [chart-releaser](https://github.com/helm/chart-releaser)
* a pre-commit hook is configured to auto-generate each chart's README from the annotations in their `values.yaml`.
  * This requires contributors to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and set up the hook (`pre-commit install && pre-commit install-hooks`). Otherwise linting will fail at CI time if any discrepancy is detected between `values.yaml` and `README`.
